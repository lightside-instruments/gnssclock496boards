The gnssclock496boards is an open hardware extension module for Ultra96
or other 96boards CE compatible devices. It uses the u-blox LEA-M8T
module or other LEA-* compatible modules.

In addition to a 1 sec PPS signal which is available on almost all
GNSS boards it has high frequency (e.g. 10 MHz clock signal) that
can be used for better precision timestamp or frequency synchronization.
